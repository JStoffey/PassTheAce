# PassTheAce
Author: Joshua Stoffey

## Description
Pass the ace is a card game where there are at least 2+ players and each player has 3 lives to start. The objective of the game is to recieve the lowest card amongst every player in the game. Players recieve a single card from the dealer in a clockwise manner. The dealer deals themself a card last. The first player clockwise to the dealer has an option to either stay with the card they were given, or trade with the player to their left. After this player has made a decision, the next player in rotation may do the same operation, and so on. Once all players have made their decisions and it is now the dealers turn, the dealer must either stay with the card they were given, or has the option to draw the first card from the deck in hopes of getting a lower card. The player (or players) with the highest card at the end of the round lose, and lose a life. The deck is now transferred clockwise to the new dealer. <br />

If there are 4 or less players remaining in the round, and all players reveal the same numerical value of their cards (tie), then all players that have lost are allowed to rejoin the game.

A king is considered a 'safe' card. If a player is dealt a king, the player must immediately flip their card to show the table and they are considered safe for that round. A card cannot be traded over a king, meaning if the player to the right of the king card wants to trade, they can no longer do so since the player to their left holds a king.
