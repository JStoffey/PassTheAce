The first player clockwise to the dealer has an option to either stay with the card they were given, or trade with the player to their left. After this player has made a decision, the next player in rotation may do the same operation, and so on. Once all players have made their decisions and it is now the dealers turn, the dealer must either stay with the card they were given, or has the option to draw the first card from the deck in hopes of getting a lower card.
